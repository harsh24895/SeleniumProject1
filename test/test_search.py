from pages.result import DuckDuckGoResultPage
from pages.search import DuckDuckGoSearchPage

    search_page = DuckDuckGoSearchPage(browser)
    result_page = DuckDuckGoResultPage(browser)
    PHRASE = "DuckDuckGo â€” Privacy, simplified." # Because of the css selector is looking for this text for test i'm mentioning this

    #give the duckduckgo home page
    search_page.load()

    #when the user searches for "panda"
    search_page.search(PHRASE)

    #then the search result title contains "panda"
    assert PHRASE in result_page.title()

    #and the search result query is "panda"
    assert PHRASE == result_page.search_input_value()
